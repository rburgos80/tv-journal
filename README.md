## TV Journal

TV Journal is a tool to help users formulate their thoughts on a show to later revisit and see their thought process during their viewing of that show. It can also be used as a way to note things down, such as possible foreshadowing and important storyline events.

## Development Process

I came up with the idea for this website after building a project similar to IMDB with the focus on looking up shows to see their ratings per episode. It was entertaining to see the general consensus on shows I was watching, but I developed a bad habit of just waiting for episodes with particularly high ratings and not paying much attention to other episodes, reducing my overall enjoyment of shows as a whole.

I decided to give this project a more personal spin and make it all about the user's opinion. There aren't any outside opinions to possibly influence what you would think of a particular show or episode as there are already plenty of websites offering individual reviews.

This entire development was a huge learning process for me as I had to pick up numerous technologies to make this possible. My biggest roadblock was figuring out a database design that works with the design of this website since I have more experience working with the frontend rather than the backend. In the end, the most important thing I took away from this process was that I have to recognize my limits as a web developer and understand that nothing is perfect, so I shouldn't obsess over how I can completely optimize everything.
