## TV Journal

TV Journal is a tool that lets users write down their thoughts during their viewings of shows in order for them to later self-reflect on their viewing experiences. It can also be used as a way for them to note down smaller things, such as possible foreshadowing and subtle storyline events.

## Development Process

I came up with the idea for this website after building a project similar to IMDB with the focus on looking up shows to see their ratings per episode. It was entertaining to see the general consensus on shows I was watching, but I developed a bad habit of just waiting for episodes with particularly high ratings and not paying much attention to other episodes, reducing my overall enjoyment of shows as a whole. 

I wanted to create something that would encourage deeper engagement with shows, so I gave this previous project a more personal spin and made it all about the user's opinions. As the name suggests, I created this website to be digital journal with an emphasis on simplicity and ease of use.

This entire development was a huge learning process for me as I had to pick up numerous technologies to make this possible. My biggest roadblock was figuring out a database design that works with the design of this website since I have more experience working with the frontend rather than the backend. In the end, the most important thing I took away from this process was that I have to recognize my limits as a web developer and understand that nothing is perfect, so I shouldn't obsess over how I can completely optimize everything.
